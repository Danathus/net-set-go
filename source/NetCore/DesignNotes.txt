The idea for this library is to form a basis of networking code.

Its dependencies should be minimal, mainly depending only on socket code.

This should absolutely NOT be dependent on Delta3D...There will be other,
higher-level libraries that can sit atop this one to bridge that gap.
This one will be pure.
